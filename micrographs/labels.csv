SEM image of 1mM ornithine after 24h of incubation. Further, the amyloid characteristics of these aggregates were also studies by coincubated amyloid binding dyes to the aggregates og hypoxanthine, xanthine, ornithine and citrulline. The Thioflavin (ThT) and CR binding assay do reveal a slight enhancement if fluorescence and absorbance which indicate the aggregates may have amyloid characteristics, however the condition need to be optimized further, (Figure 11).|Extension of Generic Amyloid Hypothesis to Metabolites of Urea Cycle and Uric Acid pathway|Monisha Patel, Shilpi Gupta, Aayushi Joshi, Basil Wilson, Manoj Pandey, Nidhi Gour|10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-w0d5g-v3
